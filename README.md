## The Problem: An Educational Divide

In Singapore's high-stakes educational landscape, access to personalized academic support is often a privilege, not a right. The high cost of private tuition creates a silent but significant divide, leaving many motivated students feeling isolated, overwhelmed, and unfairly disadvantaged. This project was born from a simple but powerful belief: a student's potential should be limited by their curiosity and drive, not their family's income.

SGenius uses the power of AI to bridge this gap, ensuring every student has the tools they need to learn confidently, ask questions without fear, and achieve their academic goals.
